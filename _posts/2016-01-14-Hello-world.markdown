Hi,
I am Akshat Tandon. I am a sophomore at IIIT-H. I always wanted to have a blog in which I can document my pursuits but I had always delayed it for some reason or the 
other. Now as part of Season of KDE I was required to document my progress in a blog
due to which I am creating this blog but I intend to continue it so that I can document my future encounters with technology.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi()
  puts "Hello World"
end
print_hi()
#=> prints 'Hello World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
