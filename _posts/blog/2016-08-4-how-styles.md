( This post is related to my GSoC project with Marble. For more more information you can read the [introductory post]({% post_url /blog/2016-08-3-why-part-gsoc %}) )

As I mentioned in my earlier post, I modified the polyshp2osm tool so as to support conversion of Natural Earth shp to OSM format so that Marble is able to render geographical features provided by the Natural Earth data set. I also had to add various stylings which were previously not present in Marble so as to enable the rendering of several geographic features.
