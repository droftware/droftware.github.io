Hi,
I always wanted to have a blog in which I can document my pursuits but I always delayed it for some reason or the other. 
As part of Season of KDE I was required to document my progress in a blog
and hence the blog but I intend to continue posting on the blog so that I can document my future encounters with technology.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi()
  puts "Hello World"
end
print_hi()
#=> prints 'Hello World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
